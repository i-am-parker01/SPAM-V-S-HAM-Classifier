# SPAM-V-S-HAM-Classifier
A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) .

Overview:
->> This project builds a text classification model on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

->> Preprocesses SMS messages (cleaning & vectorization).

->> Trains a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB).

->> Predicts whether a message is Spam or Ham.

Tech Stack:

->> Python 
->> Pandas, NumPy → Data handling
->> Scikit-learn → Model training & evaluation
->> Matplotlib/Seaborn → Data visualizationPython
->> Pandas, NumPy → Data handling
->> Scikit-learn → Model training & evaluation
->>Seaborn → Data visualization

Model Performance:
->> Accuracy: ~97%

->> Precision: High for both spam & ham

Robust against common spam patterns

 Future Improvements:

->> Use deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)
